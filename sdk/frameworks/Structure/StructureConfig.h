 Documentation of these defines.
 
 STRUCTURE_SDK_BUILD is ONLY set when building a Structure SDK binary.
 It is actually set in the build_SDK.sh script, so it is NOT set when building
 an app embedding arcturus. We mainly use it to make sure code used only in apps
 don't end up in the SDK binary to keep the size small and avoid obfuscating code
 that does not need to be shipped yet. When building the Bridge Engine SDK, it
 is NOT set either.
 
 BRIDGE_ENGINE_SDK_BUILD is ONLY set when building a BridgeEnginePrivate binary
 targetted for bridge-system. It is set in the build-partners-package.sh script.
 We use it to avoid including stuff that won't be used the a BridgeEngine release.
 When building BEDemo or other apps in arcturus, it will NOT be set. Only the script
 sets it.

 STRUCTURE_PARTNERS_BUILD is ONLY set when building a StructurePartners binary, and
 it is very similar in use to BRIDGE_ENGINE_SDK_BUILD.

 RELEASE_PUBLIC is useful to detect public Release builds, which includes SDK builds
 of Structure SDK / Bridge Engine, as well as publicly-shipped apps. Public releases use
 the ReleasePublic Xcode build configuration and include obfuscation and have many features
 disabled for security. Note that Release builds without RELEASE_PUBLIC are also obfuscated.
 
 STRUCTURE_SDK_INTERNAL_BUILD is useful to experiment with new Structure SDK features
 without making it public yet (e.g. to build an experimental version of the SDK to
 share with selected partners). Setting this when building an SDK binary
 will enable these features (option --internal-build in structure-sdk/build_SDK.sh).
 NOTE: this also gets set automatically when NOT building an SDK (i.e. building an app), 
 since our internal apps may want to have access the private API. Please follow the best
 practices described below before using it though, and avoid using STRUCTURE_SDK_INTERNAL_BUILD
 directly in code.

 RELEASE_WITH_LOGS is useful to build a release with oc_dbg, oc_info, oc_warn, and oc_error, and 
 all public logs enabled. This macro does not have any effect when building in debug. It only triggers
 the appropriate feature macros when we are in release. 
 NOTE: There are certain debugs we never want exposed even when building a release with logs. Those 
 statements can be compiled out in release by checking the macro ARCTURUS_ENABLE_L1_LOGS_IN_RELEASE
 around your debug statement. That macro is set to true only if !DEBUG && RELEASE_WITH_LOGS is true.
 If we were to only use RELEASE_WTIH_LOGS to check those conditions there is the possibility that 
 someone will build in debug and accidentaly leave RELEASE_WITH_LOGS on, effectively compiling out 
 logs that they want to see when debugging. This follows the best practices paradigm listed below. 

 BEST PRACTICES: if you want to conditionally build some chunk of code:

     1. Add a new ARCTURUS_ENABLE_XXXXX define for it

     2. In this StructureConfig.h file, define it or not depending on the variables
     above like STRUCTURE_SDK_BUILD, etc.

     This is better than directly using variables like STRUCTURE_SDK_BUILD
     in the code, since it enables a finer control. We still have lots of
     STRUCTURE_SDK_BUILD occurences in the code, but this is for historical
     purposes, initially that was the only case we supported.
